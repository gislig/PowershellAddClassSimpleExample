# PowershellAddClassSimpleExample

Current version of Powershell allows you to add classes so you can manipulate the data when it has been added to the class. Here is a simple way to create a class, this contains only a small example code on how to do this

There are alternative ways to do this such as using function and new psobjects but that might not be intended to do really professional code, so it would be a good idea to get in deeper to learn C# and classes.
